## Technology Stack
### Languages & Syntax choices
#### TypeScript
<img src="Images/typescript.png" width ="200" />
A superset of JavaScript that allows the use of static typing, interfaces and classes developed by Microsoft. 

#### ECMAScript 2015
<img src="Images/es6-js.png" width ="200" />
6th major release of the ECMAScript, JavaScript is based on ECMAScript (it is a dialect of ES6).

#### JSX Harmony
JSX harmony is a language primarily built for React.
The language was primarily used to make React components easier to read and faster to write.

#### SASS & CSS Modules
SASS is effectively an extension of CSS3.
We used SASS over plain CSS3 simply for SASS's variable constants feature.

### Frameworks & libraries we use
#### React
<img src="Images/react.png" width ="200" />
A a declarative and flexible JavaScript library for building user interfaces developed by Facebook.

### Node.js
<img src="Images/node.png" width ="200" />
Node.js is a server framework built from Chrome's JavaScript V8 engine.
It was chosen for a number of reasons.

### Babel
Babel essentially allows developers to transpile newer and alternative versions of JavaScript into older, more widely supported versions of JavaScript.
We were not unsure of whether the markers' used modern browsers so Babel ensured application compatiblity with their browsers.

### Webpack
Webpack was used to tie all together and bundle the backend and frontend applications each into single JavaScript files.
In addition, Webpack was used as a means of hot module replacement which was handy for frontend development.

### Frameworks & libraries we decided against
#### Redux
Redux is an exellent framework for managing state in an application and works well with React.
However, Redux has a functional programming based nature which didn't fit in with the assignment (object oriented assignment). 

#### React Router
React Router allows easy management of routes/url navigation. 
The assignment only really required a single page and browser history management was out of scope.
